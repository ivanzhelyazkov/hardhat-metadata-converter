# Hardhat Metadata to Standard JSON Input Converter

**This script is used to convert the metadata generated by Hardhat (`build-info.json`) to the standard JSON input format required for contract verification on Etherscan.**

## Overview

The script reads the `build-info.json` file generated by Hardhat during the compile process and extracts the relevant information to create a formatted JSON file suitable for contract verification using `solc` standard input.

## Features

- Extracts and formats the necessary fields from all source files.
- Removes unnecessary metadata fields to match the standard JSON input format.

## Usage Instructions
